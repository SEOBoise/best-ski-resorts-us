The unique topography of the area, with its steep mountain slopes and high elevation, contributes to the abundant snowfall that blankets the slopes each winter season.<br/><br/>One of the factors that sets Alta apart from other ski resorts is its location in the "lake effect zone." Situated near the Great Salt Lake, the resort benefits from the moisture-laden air that is carried over the lake and deposited as snowfall on the mountains. This phenomenon, known as lake effect snow, results in the light, fluffy powder that skiers dream of.
